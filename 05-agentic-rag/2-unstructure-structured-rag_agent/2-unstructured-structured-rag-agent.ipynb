    "# Unstructured and Structured RAG with Intelligent Query Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an advanced RAG pattern that intelligently routes queries between **structured** and **unstructured** knowledge bases using **Strands Agents** \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses custom retrieval tools that connect to Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases:\n",
    "1. **Query Analysis**: Agent analyzes incoming query to determine type\n",
    "2. **Tool Selection**: Routes to unstructured (document) or structured (SQL) assistant\n",
    "3. **Retrieval**: Appropriate knowledge base retrieves relevant information\n",
    "4. **Response Generation**: Agent synthesizes and presents the results\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enables handling both qualitative questions (business strategy, policies) and quantitative queries (financial metrics, data analysis) within a single conversational interface."

    "## Key Insights and Technical Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ **Technical Implementation Highlights**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual knowledge base RAG system demonstrates several advanced concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Modal Knowledge Integration**: Successfully combines structured (SQL/Redshift) and unstructured (PDF/documents) data sources\n",
    "2. **Intelligent Query Classification**: Uses LLM reasoning to determine query intent and route appropriately\n",
    "3. **Tool-Based Architecture**: Leverages Strands framework's `@tool` decorator for modular, reusable components\n",
    "4. **Raw Data Processing**: Agent synthesizes raw knowledge base responses into coherent, user-friendly answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **Agent Decision-Making Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent follows this reasoning pattern:\n",
    "1. **Query Analysis**: Examines the semantic content and intent\n",
    "2. **Classification**: Determines if the query requires qualitative (document) or quantitative (data) information  \n",
    "3. **Tool Selection**: Routes to the appropriate knowledge base assistant\n",
    "4. **Response Synthesis**: Processes raw retrieval results and presents insights clearly\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Use Cases and Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture is ideal for scenarios requiring:\n",
    "- **Enterprise Knowledge Management**: Combining policy documents with operational data\n",
    "- **Financial Analysis**: Mixing quantitative metrics with qualitative research\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Accessing both procedural documentation and transactional history\n",
    "- **Business Intelligence**: Blending strategic documents with analytical data\n"

    "### ✅ **What We've Accomplished**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook successfully demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dual Knowledge Base Setup**: Integration of both structured (Redshift) and unstructured (OpenSearch) knowledge bases\n",
    "2. **Intelligent Agent Orchestration**: Using Strands Agents to route queries based on semantic understanding\n",
    "3. **Custom Tool Development**: Created specialized retrieval tools for different data types\n",
    "4. **Transparent Decision Making**: Inspected agent reasoning and tool selection process\n",
    "5. **Performance Validation**: Tested routing accuracy across multiple query types\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Next Steps and Extensions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential enhancements to explore:\n",
    "- **Hybrid Queries**: Handle queries requiring both structured and unstructured information\n",
    "- **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation context across multiple knowledge bases\n",
    "- **Advanced Routing**: Implement more sophisticated query classification logic\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Add caching and response time optimization\n",
    "- **Multi-Turn Conversations**: Support follow-up questions within the same context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Strands Agents framework provides a powerful foundation for building intelligent, multi-modal RAG systems that can seamlessly combine different types of knowledge sources while maintaining transparency in the decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This architecture pattern is particularly valuable for enterprise applications where users need access to both quantitative business data and qualitative documentation through a single, intelligent interface.**\n"
