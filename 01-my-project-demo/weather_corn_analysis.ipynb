    "# 🌽 Corn Production Intelligence – Automatic Multi-Agent Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **automatic control flow** for a corn-production analysis system that relies on real-time weather data fetched from the National Weather Service (NWS) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Strands concepts in action:\n",
    "1. `agent_graph` – mesh network of specialized agents\n",
    "2. `swarm` – collaborative sub-tasks if extra brainstorming is required\n",
    "3. Custom tools wrapping NWS endpoints: `get_alerts`, `get_forecast`\n",
    "4. `mem0_memory` – persistent memory across agent interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents will decide their own control flow: when severe weather is detected, they automatically spawn a MitigationPlanner agent and route the workflow without human prompts.\n",

      "## Summary of Risk Assessment\n",
      "Based on the integrated weather and agronomic analysis, corn production in Central Iowa faces **moderate to high risk** over the next two weeks, primarily due to developing moisture stress coinciding with critical growth stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Risk Factors\n",
      "\n",
      "### Critical Weather Concerns\n",
      "- **Heat stress risk is escalating** with forecasted 90-94°F temperatures during days 5-8\n",
      "- **Precipitation deficit** (0.75 inches below normal) is likely to worsen with only minimal rainfall expected\n",
      "- **Soil moisture depletion** in the root zone will accelerate with high evapotranspiration rates (0.25-0.30 inches/day)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Agronomic Impact Analysis\n",
      "- Current growth stage (V8-V10) is entering a critical period of yield determination\n",

      "**R1-R3 (Pollination/Early Grain Fill) - HIGHEST RISK**\n",
      "- Heat above 95°F can reduce pollen viability by 20-40%\n",
      "- Each day of severe stress during pollination can reduce yield by 3-8%\n",
      "- Silking and pollen shed synchrony is disrupted by heat/moisture stress\n",
      "- Your immediate irrigation prioritization for pollinating fields is essential\n",
      "\n",
      "**V12-VT (Late Vegetative) - MODERATE RISK**\n",
      "- Fields in this stage need adequate moisture as they determine ear size potential\n",

      "- Your recommendation for regular scouting is appropriate\n",
      "\n",
      "**R4-R6 (Grain Fill) - MONITORING NEEDED**\n",
      "- While less sensitive than pollination, stress during grain fill affects kernel weight\n",
      "- The fungicide application strategy is sound as diseases can limit photosynthesis\n",
      "- Monitor stalk integrity as plants may cannibalize nutrients under stress\n",
      "\n",
      "## Additional Management Considerations\n",
      "1. Consider foliar applications with micronutrients (zinc, boron) to support pollination\n",
      "2. Monitor soil moisture at 12\" and 24\" depths to optimize irrigation efficiency\n",
      "3. Be vigilant for secondary pests that target stressed plants (spider mites, earworms)\n",
      "4. Track growing degree days to predict development stages in different field zones\n",

      "- Heavy rainfall (nutrient leaching, potential flooding)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Impact Analysis\n",
      "- **Wind concerns**: Plants are reaching maximum height with developing tassels. Winds >40mph can cause greensnap (stalk breakage) with limited recovery potential.\n",
      "- **Hail impact**: Direct hits to emerging tassels can severely impact pollination success, with 20-40% yield reduction potential.\n",
      "- **Water issues**: Saturated fields reduce oxygen to roots during this rapid growth phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Post-Storm Assessment Protocol\n",
      "1. Document damage within 24-48 hours\n",
      "2. Assess percentage of plants with:\n",

      "2. **Irrigation Priority Matrix**:\n",
      "   - Highest: Fields at 50-75% pollination with visible silk emergence\n",
      "   - High: Fields approaching pollination (within 3-5 days)\n",
      "   - Moderate: Fields past 75% pollination completion\n",

      "   - Secure nitrogen source for possible rescue application\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Post-Storm Assessment Protocol**:\n",
      "   - Wait 3-5 days to properly evaluate recovery potential\n",
      "   - Perform root lodging recovery test (plants should straighten within 7 days)\n",
      "   - Assess nitrogen status with tissue testing 5-7 days post-storm\n",

      "## Quantified Risk Analysis\n",
      "- **Timing Vulnerability**: V12-VT is among the highest sensitivity periods for water stress\n",
      "- **Water Deficit**: Current 30% chance of rainfall represents a projected deficit of 1.4-2.1 inches over next 7 days\n",
      "- **Yield Impact Potential**: 5-15% yield reduction is a conservative estimate; could reach 20-25% if stress extends through pollination\n",
      "- **Economic Impact**: Assuming 200 bu/acre potential at $4.50/bu, risk exposure is $45-$225/acre\n",

      "## Critical Thresholds & Intervention Points\n",
      "- **Water Critical Value**: Need minimum 0.2 inches/day to prevent significant yield loss\n",
      "- **Stress Indicators**: Leaf rolling before noon indicates severe stress requiring immediate intervention\n",
      "- **Point of No Return**: 3+ consecutive days of visible drought stress during pollination can cause irreversible yield damage\n",
      "\n",
      "## Risk Mitigation Recommendations\n",
      "1. **IMMEDIATE (24-48 hrs)**: Apply 1.5-2 inches irrigation if available\n",
      "2. **CONTINGENCY**: If irrigation capacity is limited:\n",
      "   - Prioritize fields based on soil water holding capacity\n",
      "   - Apply minimum 0.75 inch per irrigation event for efficiency\n",

      "3. **Yield Impact Estimation:**\n",
      "   - R1 stage heat stress may reduce yield by 3-8% per day of severe stress\n",
      "   - Incomplete pollination often results in scatter-fill ears\n",
      "   - Document with photos for insurance purposes\n",
      "\n",
      "## Post-Heat Recovery\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Maintain adequate fertility:**\n",
      "   - Ensure potassium levels are sufficient to maintain water regulation\n",
      "   - Avoid additional nitrogen application during stress period\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Monitor for secondary issues:**\n",
      "   - Heat-stressed plants are more susceptible to stalk rot\n",
      "   - Watch for increased insect pressure on weakened plants\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evaluate impact:**\n",

      "\n",
      "## Key Priorities\n",
      "Your irrigation protocol of 1.5-2\" is appropriate but should be applied:\n",
      "- Before 10AM or after 6PM to minimize evaporation\n",
      "- With priority to fields showing leaf rolling before noon\n",
      "- Focused on sandy soil areas first if water is limited\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Recommendations\n",
      "1. **Monitor pollen viability closely** - temperatures above 95°F with RH below 30% can cause complete pollen death\n",
      "2. **Silk receptivity window** is only 7-10 days - ensure moisture reaches ear zone\n",
      "3. **Kernel abortion risk** is highest 5-15 days after pollination if stress continues\n",
      "4. **Root depth assessment** is crucial - corn at this stage should have 24-36\" rooting depth\n",
      "\n",
      "## Additional Considerations\n",
      "- Consider skip-row irrigation if water is limited\n",
      "- Temporary reduction in plant transpiration from foliar antitranspirants may help preserve silk viability\n",

      "1. **Heat stress during pollination** - Temperatures above 95°F during the upcoming VT/R1 stages can reduce pollination success by 10-15% per day of extreme heat\n",
      "2. **Water deficit** - Critical water demand (0.35-0.40 inches/day) during this period makes drought particularly damaging\n",
      "3. **Nutrient availability** - Late-season nitrogen deficiency may limit yield potential\n",
      "\n",
      "### Quantified Yield Impact:\n",
      "- Heat stress during pollination: 5-25% yield reduction potential\n",
      "- Moderate drought during VT-R1: 3-8% yield reduction per day\n",
      "- Nitrogen deficiency at this stage: 10-20% yield reduction potential\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Actions and Thresholds:\n",
      "1. **Irrigation priority** (if available): Trigger irrigation at 50% available soil moisture\n",
      "2. **Heat mitigation**: If forecast exceeds 95°F for 3+ consecutive days, consider foliar applications to reduce plant stress\n",
      "3. **Nitrogen assessment**: Quick tissue testing with intervention threshold of <2.8% N in ear leaves\n",
      "4. **Insurance verification**: Confirm specific peril coverage applies to current growth stage\n",

      "   - Track leaf rolling before noon as early indicator of severe stress\n",
      "   - Monitor silk emergence timing - delays beyond 3 days indicate significant stress impact\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Financial Risk Mitigation**:\n",
      "   - At current crop prices, each day of severe stress at this growth stage represents approximately $25-40/acre in potential lost revenue\n",
      "   - Irrigation cost-benefit strongly favors intervention at this stage\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Contingency Planning**:\n",

The field triage system focusing on R1 and pre-R1 corn is particularly critical since these growth stages are most vulnerable to heat stress. Pollination failure at R1 (silking) can't be recovered and directly impacts yield potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few key agronomy-specific recommendations to strengthen your approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **For Pre-Silking Fields (V12-VT stage)**:\n",
      "   - Ensure irrigation timing is during early morning or evening to maximize water absorption\n",
      "   - Consider foliar applications with zinc and boron to support pollen viability\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **For Silking Fields (R1 stage)**:\n",
      "   - Prioritize these absolutely - even 2-3 days of extreme heat can reduce yield by 30-50%\n",
      "   - Focus irrigation directly after pollination to support kernel set\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **For Early Grain Fill (R2-R3)**:\n",
      "   - Schedule irrigation to maintain soil moisture above 50% field capacity\n",
      "   - Monitor for early kernel abortion which indicates insufficient resources\n",
      "\n",
      "Your documentation approach for insurance claims is excellent. I recommend adding specific thermal imagery if available, as heat stress symptoms can be documented before visible damage appears.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Current Situation Assessment\n",
      "At V8, your corn is approaching the critical rapid growth phase (V10-VT) where water stress can significantly impact yield. Leaf rolling is a drought stress response that reduces water loss but indicates the plant is already under moderate stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Potential Impacts\n",
      "- Not yet at yield-critical pollination stage (good)\n",
      "- However, stress now can reduce plant height, leaf area, and ear size\n",
      "- Each day of severe stress at V8-V12 can reduce yield potential by 2-3%\n",
      "\n",
      "## Management Recommendations\n",
      "1. **Irrigation**: Apply 1-1.5\" if available, prioritizing early morning\n",
      "2. **Reduce competition**: Consider emergency cultivation for weed control\n",
      "3. **Foliar fertilizer**: A light application with micronutrients may help plant resilience\n",

      "A few additional points to strengthen your approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Temperature Monitoring**:\n",
      "   - Good addition of the 86°F threshold for R1-R3. Consider also monitoring temperature differentials (day-to-night) as drops >30°F can affect pollination.\n",
      "   - For your yield calculator, include duration of heat stress (hours >90°F) as cumulative exposure significantly impacts yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Moisture Management**:\n",
      "   - Your dual-depth monitoring is excellent. Consider adding a precipitation forecasting component that triggers alerts when rain probability is <20% during critical R1-R2.\n",
      "   - The 40% field capacity emergency threshold is appropriate, but response time matters - aim for irrigation deployment within 24-36 hours of alert.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Growth Stage Assessment**:\n",
      "   - Consider implementing variable growth stage monitoring frequency (every 3 days for fields approaching VT, every 5-7 days for earlier stages).\n",
      "   - Document heat unit accumulation (GDUs) alongside physical assessment to predict timing variations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Supplemental Considerations**:\n",
      "   - Add wind speed monitoring during pollination - speeds >15mph can reduce pollination efficiency.\n",
      "   - Track silk emergence patterns within fields to identify potential fertilization issues in advance.\n",

      "- Physical damage from wind and hail\n",
      "- Disease pressure triggered by humidity and leaf wetness\n",
      "\n",
      "## Urgent Field Sampling Protocol\n",
      "For the emergency field sampling you requested:\n",
      "1. Prioritize low spots in fields with history of ponding\n",
      "2. Sample soil at 6\" and 12\" depths to determine saturation levels\n",

      "   - Pollen viability decreases significantly at temperatures above 95°F\n",
      "   - Night temperatures above 75°F can reduce pollination success\n",
      "   - Heat stress during the 2-3 week pollination window typically reduces yield more than moisture stress\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Drought Severity Assessment:**\n",
      "   - Corn at V12-VT stage requires approximately 0.33 inches of water daily\n",
      "   - Each day of visible leaf rolling before noon indicates significant moisture deficit\n",
      "   - Morning leaf recovery patterns can help quantify overnight recovery potential\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pollination Weather Window:**\n",
      "   - The 10-14 day forecast will be crucial for irrigation planning\n",
      "   - Even short periods of heat stress during pollen shed can cause significant yield loss\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations for Your Team\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For your **meteorology specialist**, request:\n",

      "2. For **irrigation timing**, advise:\n",
      "   - Focus application 2-3 days before projected tasseling if possible\n",
      "   - Morning applications are optimal as you noted, ideally completed by 9am\n",
      "   - Monitor dew point trends - lower dew points increase evaporative water loss\n",
      "\n",
      "3. For **contingency planning**:\n",
      "   - Establish temperature thresholds (>95°F for 3+ consecutive days) for yield impact scenarios\n",

      "2. **Stress Monitoring Protocol**:\n",
      "   - Track leaf rolling before noon as early indicator of severe stress\n",
      "   - Monitor silk emergence timing - delays beyond 3 days indicate significant stress impact\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Financial Risk Mitigation**:\n",
      "   - At current crop prices, each day of severe stress at this growth stage represents approximately $25-40/acre in potential lost revenue\n",

      "## Immediate Management Priorities\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Water management**:\n",
      "   - Irrigate immediately if in reproductive stages (prioritize R1-R3)\n",
      "   - Target 1-1.5\" of water before temperatures peak\n",
      "   - Use overnight irrigation when possible to minimize evaporation\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Field assessment**:\n",
      "   - Check for leaf rolling before 10am (indicates moisture stress)\n",
      "   - Monitor silk emergence and pollen viability in R1 fields\n",
      "   - Document stress symptoms for insurance purposes\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mitigation options**:\n",
      "   - Delay any planned fertilizer applications until heat subsides\n",
      "   - Postpone any non-essential field operations\n",
      "   - Consider foliar applications only during coolest part of day\n",

      "- **Moisture status**: Critical concern with only 30% chance of precipitation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Immediate Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Water management is priority #1**\n",
      "   - Schedule irrigation immediately - aim for 1-1.5 inches within 48 hours\n",
      "   - Corn water use peaks at 0.35-0.40 inches/day during this stage\n",
      "   - Water stress now will reduce tassel development and pollen production\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heat stress mitigation**\n",
      "   - Irrigate during early morning to create cooling effect during heat\n",
      "   - Avoid midday irrigation which reduces efficiency and can increase humidity/disease risk\n",
      "\n",

      "   - Target soil moisture at 70-80% field capacity specifically at 8-12\" depth (where brace roots are accessing water)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Field prioritization criteria**:\n",
      "   - Fields showing leaf rolling before 10AM should receive immediate irrigation\n",
      "   - Sandy soils need more frequent but lighter applications (0.15-0.20\" every other day)\n",
      "   - Heavier soils can receive deeper, less frequent irrigation (0.40\" every 4 days)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Kernel development monitoring**:\n",

      "\n",
      "### Weather Analysis:\n",
      "Without specific weather forecasts, I'm evaluating based on typical VT/R1 stage vulnerabilities:\n",
      "- High temperatures during pollination can significantly reduce yield (>93°F creates pollen viability issues)\n",
      "- Drought during this reproductive stage is particularly damaging\n",
      "- Strong winds can interfere with pollination and cause green snap\n",
      "\n",
      "### Crop Impact Assessment:\n",
      "- VT/R1 (tasseling/silking) is the most critical growth stage for yield determination\n",
      "- Water stress now could reduce yield potential by 5-8% per day of stress\n",
      "- Heat stress can reduce pollination effectiveness by 30-50%\n",
      "- Potential yield reduction: 20-40% if adverse conditions persist\n",
      "\n",
      "### Financial Risk:\n",
      "- Based on average Central Iowa yields (190-210 bu/acre)\n",
      "- Potential loss range: $140-$350/acre depending on severity\n",
      "- Risk threshold for intervention: $85/acre\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Actions:\n",
      "1. Implement supplemental irrigation if available\n",
      "2. Consider foliar nutrient application to reduce stress\n",
      "3. Document conditions thoroughly for insurance purposes\n",
      "4. Evaluate crop insurance protection level vs potential loss\n",
      "5. Prepare contingency marketing plans for reduced yield\n",

      "### Potential Impact Assessment:\n",
      "- **Yield Risk**: 15-25% potential yield reduction if water stress persists through forecasted heat period\n",
      "- **Economic Threshold**: Estimated $80-140/acre potential loss without intervention\n",
      "- **Secondary Risks**: Increased susceptibility to certain diseases if plants remain stressed\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendation Timeline:\n",
      "1. **Immediate (0-24 hrs)**: Deploy irrigation equipment focusing first on sandy areas showing stress\n",
      "2. **Short-term (24-48 hrs)**: Apply 0.8-1.0 inches of water across the entire field before peak heat\n",
      "3. **Extended (48-72 hrs)**: Monitor leaf moisture status daily; prepare for possible second irrigation if heat persists beyond 5 days\n",

      "2. **Field Monitoring**\n",
      "   - Track silk emergence daily in representative areas\n",
      "   - Monitor tassel development across production blocks\n",
      "   - Document pollen shed timing and duration\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Heat Mitigation Strategies**\n",
      "   - Schedule irrigation during morning hours\n",
      "   - Avoid fertilizer application during pollination stress\n",
      "   - Consider foliar applications of growth regulators if extreme stress persists\n",
      "\n",
      "Your coordination approach is excellent - the daily soil moisture monitoring is particularly important as water deficits during pollination have immediate irreversible impacts on yield potential.I'll analyze the corn heat stress situation with a focus on growth stages and management.\n",

      "# Corn Heat Stress Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "## Current Situation Assessment\n",
      "The R1 (silking) growth stage is indeed most vulnerable to heat stress because:\n",
      "- Pollen viability drops significantly above 95°F\n",
      "- Silk receptivity and fertilization are highly temperature-sensitive\n",
      "- Heat stress during pollination directly reduces kernel count, causing irreversible yield loss\n",
      "\n",
      "## Stage-Specific Vulnerability\n",
      "1. **R1 fields (silking)**: Highest priority - heat can cause asynchrony between pollen shed and silk emergence\n",
      "2. **R2 fields (blister)**: High priority - kernel abortion still possible if photosynthesis is limited\n",
      "3. **R3 fields (milk)**: Medium priority - kernel size determination may be compromised\n",
      "\n",
      "## Management Recommendations\n",
      "- **Irrigation timing**: Early morning irrigation is correct; maintain soil moisture at 75-85% field capacity\n",
      "- **Application rate**: 0.25-0.30 inches per application to minimize plant stress while conserving water\n",
      "- **Coverage**: Ensure uniform distribution focusing on plant bases rather than overhead\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recovery Assessment\n",
      "Heat stress during R1 cannot be fully mitigated, but maintaining adequate soil moisture will:\n",
      "- Reduce silk desiccation\n",
      "- Help maintain pollen viability\n",
      "- Support continued ear development\n",
      "\n",
      "Your irrigation prioritization strategy is agronomically sound. The additional potassium testing is valuable as adequate K levels help regulate water usage under stress conditions.# Agricultural Risk Assessment\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Compare weather conditions to optimal corn requirements** by growth stage\n",
      "2. **Calculate yield risk potential** using statistical modeling\n",
      "3. **Determine financial impact thresholds** based on market conditions\n",
      "4. **Assign risk levels** (Low/Medium/High/Critical)\n",
      "5. **Recommend mitigation strategies** with specific thresholds for action\n",
      "\n",
      "Please provide the specific field and weather data so I can conduct a proper risk assessment with quantified impact projections and tailored recommendations.I notice you're confused about your role.

    "## ⭐ Star Topology Workflow Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How the Star Topology Works for Corn Production:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🎯 Centralized Coordination Pattern:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "                    LeadCoordinator (Hub)\n",
    "                    /        |        \\\n",
    "     MeteorologyAgent   AgronomyAgent   RiskAnalyst\n",
    "          (Weather)       (Crops)       (Risk)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **📋 Workflow Sequence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Request Analysis** → LeadCoordinator receives corn production task\n",
    "2. **Delegation Phase** → Coordinator sends specific tasks to each specialist:\n",
    "   - **Meteorology**: \"Analyze weather alerts and forecast for Iowa\"\n",
    "   - **Agronomy**: \"Assess V12-VT growth stage vulnerability\" \n",
    "   - **Risk**: \"Calculate yield risk based on weather + crop factors\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Specialist Execution** → Each agent works independently:\n",
    "   - **Meteorology** calls `get_alerts(\"IA\")` and `get_forecast(41.59, -93.62)`\n",
    "   - **Agronomy** analyzes growth stage sensitivity\n",
    "   - **Risk** quantifies threat levels\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Report Back** → All specialists send findings to LeadCoordinator\n",
    "5. **Synthesis** → Coordinator combines all inputs into final recommendations\n",
    "6. **Decision Making** → Coordinator determines if additional actions needed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **⚡ Automatic Decision Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weather-Driven Escalation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if \"Severe Weather Warning\" in meteorology_response:\n",
    "    → LeadCoordinator automatically escalates\n",
    "    → Triggers emergency protocols\n",
    "    → Spawns MitigationPlanner if needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk-Based Actions:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if risk_level >= \"HIGH\":\n",
    "    → Automatic mitigation recommendations\n",
    "    → Emergency timeline activation\n",
    "    → Stakeholder notification protocols\n",
    "```\n",

    "| **Star Topology** | **Mesh Topology** |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| ✅ Clear hierarchy and delegation | ✅ Peer-to-peer collaboration |\n",
    "| ✅ Centralized decision making | ✅ Distributed intelligence |\n",
    "| ✅ Single point of coordination | ✅ Redundant communication paths |\n",
    "| ⚠️ Coordinator bottleneck | ⚠️ Complex coordination overhead |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🌽 Why Star Works Well for Agriculture:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Chain of Command** - Like farm management hierarchy\n",
    "2. **Specialist Focus** - Each agent has defined expertise area\n",
    "3. **Centralized Risk Assessment** - Critical for farming decisions\n",
    "4. **Emergency Protocols** - Quick escalation through coordinator\n",
    "5. **Resource Efficiency** - No redundant communications between specialists\n",
    "\n",
    "The star topology provides **structured, hierarchical coordination** perfect for agricultural decision-making where clear authority and specialized expertise are essential! 🌟\n"

    "## 🚀 Key Takeaways: Automatic Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated several key concepts for **automatic control flow** in multi-agent systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤖 **Autonomous Decision Making**\n",
    "- **LeadCoordinator** automatically determines which agents to engage based on request analysis\n",
    "- **Dynamic agent spawning** when conditions warrant (severe weather → MitigationPlanner)\n",
    "- **Adaptive workflows** that change based on discovered conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 **Multi-Agent Coordination Tools**\n",
    "- **`agent_graph`**: Creates mesh networks where agents communicate directly\n",
    "- **`swarm`**: Enables collaborative intelligence for complex analysis\n",
    "- **`mem0_memory`**: Provides persistent context and learning across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Real-World Integration**\n",
    "- **National Weather Service API**: Live weather data driving decisions\n",
    "- **Domain-specific agents**: Meteorology, Agronomy, Risk Assessment specialists\n",
    "- **Threshold-based triggers**: Automatic escalation based on risk levels\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 **Scalability Patterns**\n",
    "- **Mesh topology**: All agents can communicate without bottlenecks\n",
    "- **Event-driven coordination**: Weather alerts trigger cascading responses\n",
    "- **Memory-driven context**: Past decisions inform current actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **Next Steps for Production**\n",
    "1. **Deploy NWS tools as MCP server** for scalable weather data access\n",
    "2. **Add more specialized agents** (DataViz, CitationAgent, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Implement threshold-based spawning logic** in agent prompts\n",
    "4. **Add observability** with LangFuse integration\n",
    "5. **Scale to multiple geographic regions** and crop types\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of this approach is that **agents decide their own control flow** - the system adapts automatically to changing conditions without requiring human intervention to manage the workflow.\n"
