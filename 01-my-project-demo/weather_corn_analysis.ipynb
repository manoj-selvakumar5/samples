    "# 🌽 Corn Production Intelligence – Automatic Multi-Agent Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **automatic control flow** for a corn-production analysis system that relies on real-time weather data fetched from the National Weather Service (NWS) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Strands concepts in action:\n",
    "1. `agent_graph` – mesh network of specialized agents\n",
    "2. `swarm` – collaborative sub-tasks if extra brainstorming is required\n",
    "3. Custom tools wrapping NWS endpoints: `get_alerts`, `get_forecast`\n",
    "4. `mem0_memory` – persistent memory across agent interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents will decide their own control flow: when severe weather is detected, they automatically spawn a MitigationPlanner agent and route the workflow without human prompts.\n",
