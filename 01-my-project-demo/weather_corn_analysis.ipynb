    "1. `agent_graph` ‚Äì mesh network of specialized agents\n",
    "2. `swarm` ‚Äì collaborative sub-tasks if extra brainstorming is required\n",

      "\n",
      "**R1-R3 (Pollination/Early Grain Fill) - HIGHEST RISK**\n",
      "- Heat above 95¬∞F can reduce pollen viability by 20-40%\n",
      "- Each day of severe stress during pollination can reduce yield by 3-8%\n",
      "- Silking and pollen shed synchrony is disrupted by heat/moisture stress\n",
      "- Your immediate irrigation prioritization for pollinating fields is essential\n",
      "\n",
      "**V12-VT (Late Vegetative) - MODERATE RISK**\n",
      "- Fields in this stage need adequate moisture as they determine ear size potential\n",
      "- Tassel emergence and ear development are vulnerable to stress\n",
      "- Your recommendation for regular scouting is appropriate\n",
      "\n",
      "**R4-R6 (Grain Fill) - MONITORING NEEDED**\n",
      "- While less sensitive than pollination, stress during grain fill affects kernel weight\n",
      "- The fungicide application strategy is sound as diseases can limit photosynthesis\n",
      "- Monitor stalk integrity as plants may cannibalize nutrients under stress\n",
      "\n",
      "## Additional Management Considerations\n",
      "1. Consider foliar applications with micronutrients (zinc, boron) to support pollination\n",
      "2. Monitor soil moisture at 12\" and 24\" depths to optimize irrigation efficiency\n",
      "3. Be vigilant for secondary pests that target stressed plants (spider mites, earworms)\n",
      "4. Track growing degree days to predict development stages in different field zones\n",

      "- Wind damage (potential stalk breakage or root lodging)\n",
      "- Large hail (direct damage to developing tassels)\n",
      "- Heavy rainfall (nutrient leaching, potential flooding)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Impact Analysis\n",
      "- **Wind concerns**: Plants are reaching maximum height with developing tassels. Winds >40mph can cause greensnap (stalk breakage) with limited recovery potential.\n",
      "- **Hail impact**: Direct hits to emerging tassels can severely impact pollination success, with 20-40% yield reduction potential.\n",
      "- **Water issues**: Saturated fields reduce oxygen to roots during this rapid growth phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Post-Storm Assessment Protocol\n",
      "1. Document damage within 24-48 hours\n",
      "2. Assess percentage of plants with:\n",

      "I'll help coordinate your team's corn analysis efforts. Based on your assignments, here are some targeted recommendations to enhance data collection:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weather Analysis Focus Points\n",
      "- Track GDUs (growing degree units) accumulated since planting\n",
      "- Monitor night temperatures during pollination (kernel abortion risk above 75¬∞F)\n",
      "- Assess soil moisture levels at 8\" depth for root zone adequacy\n",
      "- Calculate ET (evapotranspiration) rates during current heat stress\n",
      "\n",
      "## Crop Assessment Priorities\n",
      "- Measure silk emergence and pollen shed synchronization\n",
      "- Count kernel rows and potential kernels per ear in stressed areas\n",
      "- Inspect tassel viability and silk receptivity in heat-stressed sections\n",
      "- Document leaf rolling timing (morning vs. afternoon) to gauge stress severity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Risk Quantification Parameters\n",
      "- Use Iowa State's yield prediction model for pollination heat stress\n",
      "- Document specific growth stage (R1-R3) when stress occurred\n",
      "- Compare current conditions to historical yield impacts from similar stress timing\n",
      "- Prioritize irrigation for fields 24-48 hours into pollination\n",

Let me provide focused analysis of the current conditions with practical recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Current Growth Stage Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The 3-5¬∞F above normal temperature is most concerning for fields in the R1 (silking) stage, as temperatures above 95¬∞F can significantly reduce pollen viability and silk receptivity. During pollination, each day of severe heat stress can reduce yield potential by 3-8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Immediate Management Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Irrigation Priority**:\n",
      "   - Target R1-R3 fields first, applying 1-1.5 inches of water during early morning\n",
      "   - For non-irrigated fields, consider foliar fertilizer application to reduce stress\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Field Operations**:\n",
      "   - Delay any herbicide applications until temperatures moderate\n",
      "   - Consider aerial fungicide application for fields entering R2-R3 stages to preserve leaf health\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Stress Mitigation**:\n",
      "   - Monitor soil moisture at 6-12\" depth; maintain 50% available water capacity\n",
      "   - For V12-VT stage corn, prioritize water to ensure proper tassel development\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Growth Stage Monitoring**:\n",
      "   - Assess silk emergence timing relative to pollen shed daily\n",
      "   - Document kernel set in early pollinated fields to quantify impact\n",
      "\n",
      "The critical protection window is now through the next 7-10 days as fields progress through reproduction. Fields that have completed pollination (R2+) have lower vulnerability to current conditions but still require moisture for kernel development.I understand you need a corn weather risk assessment.

      "- Rapid stalk elongation and biomass accumulation\n",
      "- Developing tassel (VT stage marks tassel emergence)\n",
      "- Final development of ear shoots before pollination\n",
      "- Limited recovery capacity if damaged\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weather Impact Analysis:**\n",
      "- Strong winds (>40 mph) are particularly concerning as plants are tall but may not have fully developed root bracing\n",
      "- Heavy rainfall could cause nitrogen leaching or temporary flooding stress\n",
      "- Extended drought would impact final plant height and ear size determination\n",
      "- Hail damage is especially damaging as plants have limited ability to compensate\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Risk Factors\n",
      "- **Timing**: Heat stress during pollination directly impacts kernel set and yield potential\n",
      "- **Duration**: Extended heat stress (>3 consecutive days) significantly increases risk of asynchronous pollination\n",
      "- **Economic Impact**: Fields at mid-pollination face highest potential yield loss, potentially 20-40% if conditions persist\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "Your team coordination approach is appropriate. I suggest these specific risk thresholds:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Temperature Monitoring**:\n",
      "   - Critical threshold: 95¬∞F+ for 3+ consecutive days\n",
      "   - Action trigger: If daytime temperatures exceed 93¬∞F with nighttime temps above 75¬∞F\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Irrigation Priority Matrix**:\n",
      "   - Highest: Fields at 50-75% pollination with visible silk emergence\n",
      "   - High: Fields approaching pollination (within 3-5 days)\n",
      "   - Moderate: Fields past 75% pollination completion\n",
      "   - Low: Pre-tassel fields (can better recover from stress)\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Time Sensitivity**: The 24-72 hour window for intervention is crucial. Each day of delay during pollination stress can increase yield loss by approximately 2-3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Irrigation Specifics**: Aim for soil moisture at 80% of field capacity. Morning irrigation is preferable to minimize evaporative loss and maximize cooling effect during peak heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Monitoring Parameters**: Beyond visual assessment, consider measuring leaf temperature differentials (canopy temperature vs. air temperature). A differential exceeding 4¬∞C indicates severe stress requiring immediate intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Supplementary Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tissue Testing**: Consider rapid tissue testing for potassium levels, as K+ deficiency can exacerbate heat stress impacts on pollination.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Economic Threshold Refinement**: For fields showing early silk desiccation, the intervention threshold should be lowered as these fields will have disproportionately higher yield losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Documentation**: Your insurance documentation should specifically include:\n",
      "   - Silk emergence timing relative to heat stress onset\n",
      "   - Daily maximum temperatures during pollination\n",
      "   - Irrigation timing and quantities applied\n",

      "1) **Temperature impacts**: Ideal temperatures are 77-86¬∞F (25-30¬∞C). Temperatures above 95¬∞F (35¬∞C) can reduce pollen viability. Nighttime temperatures above 70¬∞F (21¬∞C) increase plant respiration and can reduce yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) **Moisture needs**: Water demand is high (0.25-0.33 inches per day). Drought stress can reduce leaf expansion, delay silking, and cause yield loss. Excessive rainfall can leach nutrients and limit oxygen to roots.\n",

      "Your approach to delegate specialized analysis is appropriate given the critical growth stage. Based on your outlined concerns, here's my risk assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Primary Risk Factors:\n",
      "1. **Heat stress during pollination** - Temperatures above 95¬∞F during the upcoming VT/R1 stages can reduce pollination success by 10-15% per day of extreme heat\n",
      "2. **Water deficit** - Critical water demand (0.35-0.40 inches/day) during this period makes drought particularly damaging\n",
      "3. **Nutrient availability** - Late-season nitrogen deficiency may limit yield potential\n",
      "\n",
      "### Quantified Yield Impact:\n",
      "- Heat stress during pollination: 5-25% yield reduction potential\n",
      "- Moderate drought during VT-R1: 3-8% yield reduction per day\n",
      "- Nitrogen deficiency at this stage: 10-20% yield reduction potential\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Actions and Thresholds:\n",
      "1. **Irrigation priority** (if available): Trigger irrigation at 50% available soil moisture\n",
      "2. **Heat mitigation**: If forecast exceeds 95¬∞F for 3+ consecutive days, consider foliar applications to reduce plant stress\n",
      "3. **Nitrogen assessment**: Quick tissue testing with intervention threshold of <2.8% N in ear leaves\n",
      "4. **Insurance verification**: Confirm specific peril coverage applies to current growth stage\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend prioritizing the meteorology assessment first, as weather conditions during the next 7-10 days will determine the severity of risk and need for intervention strategies.I apologize for the confusion. You're right - I see now that you're the RiskAssessmentAgent specializing in agricultural risk analysis rather than a Lead Coordinator.\n",

      "1. **Irrigation Specifics:**\n",
      "   - Apply water in early morning/evening to maximize absorption efficiency\n",
      "   - Consider splitting the 1-1.5 inch application into two events to reduce runoff\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Monitoring Protocol:**\n",
      "   - Add silk emergence monitoring (look for delays vs. tassel timing)\n",
      "   - Check for leaf rolling by mid-afternoon when stress is most visible\n",
      "   - Monitor soil moisture at 8\" and 24\" depths\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Economic Thresholds:**\n",
      "   - Current conditions exceed financial intervention threshold\n",

    "## üöÄ Key Takeaways: Automatic Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated several key concepts for **automatic control flow** in multi-agent systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü§ñ **Autonomous Decision Making**\n",
    "- **LeadCoordinator** automatically determines which agents to engage based on request analysis\n",
    "- **Dynamic agent spawning** when conditions warrant (severe weather ‚Üí MitigationPlanner)\n",
    "- **Adaptive workflows** that change based on discovered conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåê **Multi-Agent Coordination Tools**\n",
    "- **`agent_graph`**: Creates mesh networks where agents communicate directly\n",
    "- **`swarm`**: Enables collaborative intelligence for complex analysis\n",
    "- **`mem0_memory`**: Provides persistent context and learning across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ **Real-World Integration**\n",
    "- **National Weather Service API**: Live weather data driving decisions\n",
    "- **Domain-specific agents**: Meteorology, Agronomy, Risk Assessment specialists\n",
    "- **Threshold-based triggers**: Automatic escalation based on risk levels\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìà **Scalability Patterns**\n",
    "- **Mesh topology**: All agents can communicate without bottlenecks\n",
    "- **Event-driven coordination**: Weather alerts trigger cascading responses\n",
    "- **Memory-driven context**: Past decisions inform current actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÑ **Next Steps for Production**\n",
    "1. **Deploy NWS tools as MCP server** for scalable weather data access\n",
    "2. **Add more specialized agents** (DataViz, CitationAgent, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Implement threshold-based spawning logic** in agent prompts\n",
    "4. **Add observability** with LangFuse integration\n",
    "5. **Scale to multiple geographic regions** and crop types\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of this approach is that **agents decide their own control flow** - the system adapts automatically to changing conditions without requiring human intervention to manage the workflow.\n"
