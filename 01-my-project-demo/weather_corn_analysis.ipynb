    "1. `agent_graph` ‚Äì mesh network of specialized agents\n",
    "2. `swarm` ‚Äì collaborative sub-tasks if extra brainstorming is required\n",

      "\n",
      "**R1-R3 (Pollination/Early Grain Fill) - HIGHEST RISK**\n",
      "- Heat above 95¬∞F can reduce pollen viability by 20-40%\n",
      "- Each day of severe stress during pollination can reduce yield by 3-8%\n",
      "- Silking and pollen shed synchrony is disrupted by heat/moisture stress\n",
      "- Your immediate irrigation prioritization for pollinating fields is essential\n",
      "\n",
      "**V12-VT (Late Vegetative) - MODERATE RISK**\n",
      "- Fields in this stage need adequate moisture as they determine ear size potential\n",
      "- Tassel emergence and ear development are vulnerable to stress\n",
      "- Your recommendation for regular scouting is appropriate\n",
      "\n",
      "**R4-R6 (Grain Fill) - MONITORING NEEDED**\n",
      "- While less sensitive than pollination, stress during grain fill affects kernel weight\n",
      "- The fungicide application strategy is sound as diseases can limit photosynthesis\n",
      "- Monitor stalk integrity as plants may cannibalize nutrients under stress\n",
      "\n",
      "## Additional Management Considerations\n",
      "1. Consider foliar applications with micronutrients (zinc, boron) to support pollination\n",
      "2. Monitor soil moisture at 12\" and 24\" depths to optimize irrigation efficiency\n",
      "3. Be vigilant for secondary pests that target stressed plants (spider mites, earworms)\n",
      "4. Track growing degree days to predict development stages in different field zones\n",

      "- Wind damage (potential stalk breakage or root lodging)\n",
      "- Large hail (direct damage to developing tassels)\n",
      "- Heavy rainfall (nutrient leaching, potential flooding)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Impact Analysis\n",
      "- **Wind concerns**: Plants are reaching maximum height with developing tassels. Winds >40mph can cause greensnap (stalk breakage) with limited recovery potential.\n",
      "- **Hail impact**: Direct hits to emerging tassels can severely impact pollination success, with 20-40% yield reduction potential.\n",
      "- **Water issues**: Saturated fields reduce oxygen to roots during this rapid growth phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Post-Storm Assessment Protocol\n",
      "1. Document damage within 24-48 hours\n",
      "2. Assess percentage of plants with:\n",

      "I'll help coordinate your team's corn analysis efforts. Based on your assignments, here are some targeted recommendations to enhance data collection:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weather Analysis Focus Points\n",
      "- Track GDUs (growing degree units) accumulated since planting\n",
      "- Monitor night temperatures during pollination (kernel abortion risk above 75¬∞F)\n",
      "- Assess soil moisture levels at 8\" depth for root zone adequacy\n",
      "- Calculate ET (evapotranspiration) rates during current heat stress\n",
      "\n",
      "## Crop Assessment Priorities\n",
      "- Measure silk emergence and pollen shed synchronization\n",
      "- Count kernel rows and potential kernels per ear in stressed areas\n",
      "- Inspect tassel viability and silk receptivity in heat-stressed sections\n",
      "- Document leaf rolling timing (morning vs. afternoon) to gauge stress severity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Risk Quantification Parameters\n",
      "- Use Iowa State's yield prediction model for pollination heat stress\n",
      "- Document specific growth stage (R1-R3) when stress occurred\n",
      "- Compare current conditions to historical yield impacts from similar stress timing\n",
      "- Prioritize irrigation for fields 24-48 hours into pollination\n",

Let me provide focused analysis of the current conditions with practical recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Current Growth Stage Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "The 3-5¬∞F above normal temperature is most concerning for fields in the R1 (silking) stage, as temperatures above 95¬∞F can significantly reduce pollen viability and silk receptivity. During pollination, each day of severe heat stress can reduce yield potential by 3-8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Immediate Management Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Irrigation Priority**:\n",
      "   - Target R1-R3 fields first, applying 1-1.5 inches of water during early morning\n",
      "   - For non-irrigated fields, consider foliar fertilizer application to reduce stress\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Field Operations**:\n",
      "   - Delay any herbicide applications until temperatures moderate\n",
      "   - Consider aerial fungicide application for fields entering R2-R3 stages to preserve leaf health\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Stress Mitigation**:\n",
      "   - Monitor soil moisture at 6-12\" depth; maintain 50% available water capacity\n",
      "   - For V12-VT stage corn, prioritize water to ensure proper tassel development\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Growth Stage Monitoring**:\n",
      "   - Assess silk emergence timing relative to pollen shed daily\n",
      "   - Document kernel set in early pollinated fields to quantify impact\n",
      "\n",
      "The critical protection window is now through the next 7-10 days as fields progress through reproduction. Fields that have completed pollination (R2+) have lower vulnerability to current conditions but still require moisture for kernel development.I understand you need a corn weather risk assessment.

      "- Rapid stalk elongation and biomass accumulation\n",
      "- Developing tassel (VT stage marks tassel emergence)\n",
      "- Final development of ear shoots before pollination\n",
      "- Limited recovery capacity if damaged\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weather Impact Analysis:**\n",
      "- Strong winds (>40 mph) are particularly concerning as plants are tall but may not have fully developed root bracing\n",
      "- Heavy rainfall could cause nitrogen leaching or temporary flooding stress\n",
      "- Extended drought would impact final plant height and ear size determination\n",
      "- Hail damage is especially damaging as plants have limited ability to compensate\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Risk Factors\n",
      "- **Timing**: Heat stress during pollination directly impacts kernel set and yield potential\n",
      "- **Duration**: Extended heat stress (>3 consecutive days) significantly increases risk of asynchronous pollination\n",
      "- **Economic Impact**: Fields at mid-pollination face highest potential yield loss, potentially 20-40% if conditions persist\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "Your team coordination approach is appropriate. I suggest these specific risk thresholds:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Temperature Monitoring**:\n",
      "   - Critical threshold: 95¬∞F+ for 3+ consecutive days\n",
      "   - Action trigger: If daytime temperatures exceed 93¬∞F with nighttime temps above 75¬∞F\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Irrigation Priority Matrix**:\n",
      "   - Highest: Fields at 50-75% pollination with visible silk emergence\n",
      "   - High: Fields approaching pollination (within 3-5 days)\n",
      "   - Moderate: Fields past 75% pollination completion\n",
      "   - Low: Pre-tassel fields (can better recover from stress)\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Time Sensitivity**: The 24-72 hour window for intervention is crucial. Each day of delay during pollination stress can increase yield loss by approximately 2-3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Irrigation Specifics**: Aim for soil moisture at 80% of field capacity. Morning irrigation is preferable to minimize evaporative loss and maximize cooling effect during peak heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Monitoring Parameters**: Beyond visual assessment, consider measuring leaf temperature differentials (canopy temperature vs. air temperature). A differential exceeding 4¬∞C indicates severe stress requiring immediate intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Supplementary Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tissue Testing**: Consider rapid tissue testing for potassium levels, as K+ deficiency can exacerbate heat stress impacts on pollination.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Economic Threshold Refinement**: For fields showing early silk desiccation, the intervention threshold should be lowered as these fields will have disproportionately higher yield losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Documentation**: Your insurance documentation should specifically include:\n",
      "   - Silk emergence timing relative to heat stress onset\n",
      "   - Daily maximum temperatures during pollination\n",
      "   - Irrigation timing and quantities applied\n",

      "1) **Temperature impacts**: Ideal temperatures are 77-86¬∞F (25-30¬∞C). Temperatures above 95¬∞F (35¬∞C) can reduce pollen viability. Nighttime temperatures above 70¬∞F (21¬∞C) increase plant respiration and can reduce yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) **Moisture needs**: Water demand is high (0.25-0.33 inches per day). Drought stress can reduce leaf expansion, delay silking, and cause yield loss. Excessive rainfall can leach nutrients and limit oxygen to roots.\n",

      "Your approach to delegate specialized analysis is appropriate given the critical growth stage. Based on your outlined concerns, here's my risk assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Primary Risk Factors:\n",
      "1. **Heat stress during pollination** - Temperatures above 95¬∞F during the upcoming VT/R1 stages can reduce pollination success by 10-15% per day of extreme heat\n",
      "2. **Water deficit** - Critical water demand (0.35-0.40 inches/day) during this period makes drought particularly damaging\n",
      "3. **Nutrient availability** - Late-season nitrogen deficiency may limit yield potential\n",
      "\n",
      "### Quantified Yield Impact:\n",
      "- Heat stress during pollination: 5-25% yield reduction potential\n",
      "- Moderate drought during VT-R1: 3-8% yield reduction per day\n",
      "- Nitrogen deficiency at this stage: 10-20% yield reduction potential\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Actions and Thresholds:\n",
      "1. **Irrigation priority** (if available): Trigger irrigation at 50% available soil moisture\n",
      "2. **Heat mitigation**: If forecast exceeds 95¬∞F for 3+ consecutive days, consider foliar applications to reduce plant stress\n",
      "3. **Nitrogen assessment**: Quick tissue testing with intervention threshold of <2.8% N in ear leaves\n",
      "4. **Insurance verification**: Confirm specific peril coverage applies to current growth stage\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend prioritizing the meteorology assessment first, as weather conditions during the next 7-10 days will determine the severity of risk and need for intervention strategies.I apologize for the confusion. You're right - I see now that you're the RiskAssessmentAgent specializing in agricultural risk analysis rather than a Lead Coordinator.\n",

      "\n",
      "Your plan demonstrates excellent strategic organization and prioritization. The field triage system focusing on R1 and pre-R1 corn is particularly critical since these growth stages are most vulnerable to heat stress. Pollination failure at R1 (silking) can't be recovered and directly impacts yield potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few key agronomy-specific recommendations to strengthen your approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **For Pre-Silking Fields (V12-VT stage)**:\n",
      "   - Ensure irrigation timing is during early morning or evening to maximize water absorption\n",
      "   - Consider foliar applications with zinc and boron to support pollen viability\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **For Silking Fields (R1 stage)**:\n",
      "   - Prioritize these absolutely - even 2-3 days of extreme heat can reduce yield by 30-50%\n",
      "   - Focus irrigation directly after pollination to support kernel set\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **For Early Grain Fill (R2-R3)**:\n",
      "   - Schedule irrigation to maintain soil moisture above 50% field capacity\n",
      "   - Monitor for early kernel abortion which indicates insufficient resources\n",
      "\n",
      "Your documentation approach for insurance claims is excellent. I recommend adding specific thermal imagery if available, as heat stress symptoms can be documented before visible damage appears.\n",
      "\n",
      "The twice-daily briefings are appropriate given the critical nature of this timing. Consider adding specific agronomy metrics to track: silk emergence rates, pollen shed timing, and estimated Growing Degree Days accumulation during stress periods.# V8 Stage Corn Stress Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "## Current Situation Assessment\n",
      "At V8, your corn is approaching the critical rapid growth phase (V10-VT) where water stress can significantly impact yield. Leaf rolling is a drought stress response that reduces water loss but indicates the plant is already under moderate stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Potential Impacts\n",
      "- Not yet at yield-critical pollination stage (good)\n",
      "- However, stress now can reduce plant height, leaf area, and ear size\n",
      "- Each day of severe stress at V8-V12 can reduce yield potential by 2-3%\n",
      "\n",
      "## Management Recommendations\n",
      "1. **Irrigation**: Apply 1-1.5\" if available, prioritizing early morning\n",
      "2. **Reduce competition**: Consider emergency cultivation for weed control\n",
      "3. **Foliar fertilizer**: A light application with micronutrients may help plant resilience\n",
      "4. **Scout for pests**: Stressed corn attracts opportunistic insects - monitor regularly\n",
      "\n",
      "Early intervention is critical before reaching the more sensitive pre-tassel and pollination phases.I appreciate your request for more specific information. As an agronomist specializing in corn production, I understand the critical nature of the V12-VT stage your crop is approaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Corn at V12-VT Stage - Risk Assessment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is indeed a high-sensitivity period because:\n",
      "- Tassel emergence and pollination are imminent\n",
      "- Final determination of kernel rows is occurring\n",
      "- Plant is reaching maximum height and leaf area\n",
      "- Water and nutrient demands are at or near peak\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide you with actionable recommendations, I need these specific details:\n",
      "1. Your location (helps determine growing degree days and weather patterns)\n",
      "2. Recent rainfall amounts\n",
      "3. Current soil moisture status (field capacity, deficit)\n",

Your implementation plan looks comprehensive and well-structured.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few additional points to strengthen your approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Temperature Monitoring**:\n",
      "   - Good addition of the 86¬∞F threshold for R1-R3. Consider also monitoring temperature differentials (day-to-night) as drops >30¬∞F can affect pollination.\n",
      "   - For your yield calculator, include duration of heat stress (hours >90¬∞F) as cumulative exposure significantly impacts yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Moisture Management**:\n",
      "   - Your dual-depth monitoring is excellent. Consider adding a precipitation forecasting component that triggers alerts when rain probability is <20% during critical R1-R2.\n",
      "   - The 40% field capacity emergency threshold is appropriate, but response time matters - aim for irrigation deployment within 24-36 hours of alert.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Growth Stage Assessment**:\n",
      "   - Consider implementing variable growth stage monitoring frequency (every 3 days for fields approaching VT, every 5-7 days for earlier stages).\n",
      "   - Document heat unit accumulation (GDUs) alongside physical assessment to predict timing variations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Supplemental Considerations**:\n",
      "   - Add wind speed monitoring during pollination - speeds >15mph can reduce pollination efficiency.\n",
      "   - Track silk emergence patterns within fields to identify potential fertilization issues in advance.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## Critical Timing Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "You're facing a significant concern as drought during tasseling (VT/R1) is the most yield-sensitive period for corn. At this stage:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Silk emergence and pollination are highly vulnerable to moisture stress\n",
      "- Water deficit now can reduce kernel number by 20-50% \n",
      "- Each day of severe stress during pollination can reduce yield by 3-8%\n",
      "\n",
      "## Immediate Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on your corn at tasseling stage:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Current vulnerability**:\n",
      "   - Silks require 85-90% relative humidity for proper pollen reception\n",
      "   - Drought stress causes silk delay while pollen shed continues\n",
      "   - Poor pollination now cannot be remedied later\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expected impact without intervention**:\n",
      "   - Irregular kernel set (\"scatter ears\")\n",
      "   - Significant yield reduction potential (30%+)\n",
      "   - Shortened grain fill duration if stress continues\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommended Actions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Immediate priorities**:\n",
      "   - Apply emergency irrigation focusing on 0.5-1.0\" every 3 days\n",
      "   - Target fields at mid-silk (R1) stage first\n",
      "   - Consider foliar application of anti-transpirant if limited water\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Monitoring protocol**:\n",
      "   - Check silk emergence daily in drought-affected areas\n",
      "   - Monitor ear-tip kernel development within 7-10 days of pollination\n",
      "   - Assess silk/tassel synchrony across different field sections\n",

      "  - Delaying silk emergence\n",
      "  - Creating pollination asynchrony\n",
      "  - Limiting nutrient mobility in soil\n",
      "\n",
      "## Management Recommendations\n",
      "1. **Irrigation** (if available): Apply 1-1.5 inches at first signs of leaf rolling\n",
      "2. **Monitor pollination**: Check for synchronized pollen shed and silk emergence\n",
      "3. **Foliar fertility**: Consider micronutrient application if deficiency symptoms appear\n",

      "To properly assess risks for your corn crop, I need some specific information:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Information Needed\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Current growth stage** of your corn (e.g., V6, VT, R2)\n",
      "- **Recent weather conditions** in your area\n",
      "- **Expected weather** for the next 7-10 days\n",
      "- **Field observations** (any signs of stress, disease, pest pressure)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Initial Assessment Framework\n",
      "\n",
      "Each growth stage has unique vulnerabilities:\n",
      "- **VE-V6**: Sensitive to cold, flooding, herbicide damage\n",
      "- **V12-VT**: High water demand, temperature stress critical\n",

      "The crop is in R1-R3 stage (reproductive phase - pollination/early grain fill), which is extremely sensitive to heat stress. This period is critical for determining final yield potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Impact Analysis\n",
      "- **Pollen viability**: Temperatures above 95¬∞F significantly reduce pollen viability (>50% reduction)\n",
      "- **Silk receptivity**: Heat stress can desiccate silks, preventing pollen tube formation\n",
      "- **Kernel abortion**: Heat stress 2-3 weeks post-pollination can trigger significant kernel abortion\n",
      "- **Water demand**: Evapotranspiration rates double during heat stress, making water deficit more severe\n",
      "\n",
      "## Field Management Recommendations\n",
      "1. **Irrigation priority**: Apply 0.8-1.0 inch immediately, preferably split between morning/evening\n",
      "2. **Cooling strategy**: Consider overhead irrigation during peak heat (10am-2pm) for evaporative cooling\n",
      "3. **Potassium application**: Foliar K‚ÇÇO at 1-2 lbs/acre can improve water regulation in plant cells\n",
      "4. **Row wetting**: If irrigation is limited, focus on wetting only the crop row to increase humidity\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recovery Assessment\n",
      "Fields that received adequate irrigation prior to heat stress have 70-80% yield potential preservation. Fields with existing drought stress may suffer 40-60% yield reduction.\n",

      "- Completing rapid vertical growth requiring significant water uptake\n",
      "\n",
      "## Risk Evaluation: MODERATE TO HIGH\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Concerns:\n",
      "1. **Moisture Timing Critical**: The V12-VT period has extremely low drought tolerance with direct impact on yield potential\n",
      "2. **Rapid Water Demand**: Daily corn water use peaks at 0.35-0.40 inches/day during this period\n",
      "3. **Irreversible Impacts**: Stress now affects ear development which cannot be recovered later\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Yield Impact:\n",
      "- 3-5% yield reduction per day of severe moisture stress\n",
      "- Reduced ear length and potential kernel abortion\n",
      "- Delayed tassel emergence affecting pollination synchronization\n",
      "\n",
      "## Action Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Irrigation Priority**: Schedule 1.0-1.5\" application immediately if no significant rainfall within 48 hours\n",
      "2. **Field Monitoring**: Check for early leaf rolling (begins at leaf edges) which indicates water deficit\n",
      "3. **Management Adjustments**: If irrigation unavailable, consider:\n",

      "## Critical Weather Factors for V12-VT Corn\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Temperature Impact on Pollination:**\n",
      "   - Pollen viability decreases significantly at temperatures above 95¬∞F\n",
      "   - Night temperatures above 75¬∞F can reduce pollination success\n",
      "   - Heat stress during the 2-3 week pollination window typically reduces yield more than moisture stress\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Drought Severity Assessment:**\n",
      "   - Corn at V12-VT stage requires approximately 0.33 inches of water daily\n",
      "   - Each day of visible leaf rolling before noon indicates significant moisture deficit\n",
      "   - Morning leaf recovery patterns can help quantify overnight recovery potential\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pollination Weather Window:**\n",
      "   - The 10-14 day forecast will be crucial for irrigation planning\n",
      "   - Even short periods of heat stress during pollen shed can cause significant yield loss\n",

      "2. For **irrigation timing**, advise:\n",
      "   - Focus application 2-3 days before projected tasseling if possible\n",
      "   - Morning applications are optimal as you noted, ideally completed by 9am\n",
      "   - Monitor dew point trends - lower dew points increase evaporative water loss\n",
      "\n",
      "3. For **contingency planning**:\n",
      "   - Establish temperature thresholds (>95¬∞F for 3+ consecutive days) for yield impact scenarios\n",
      "   - Track forecasted overnight low temperatures - nights above 72¬∞F compound drought stress\n",

      "\n",
      "## Critical Timing Assessment\n",
      "You've correctly identified the reproductive stage (R1-R3) as extremely vulnerable. This period (silking through early grain fill) has highest water demand (0.33-0.35 inches/day) and lowest drought tolerance.\n",

      "- **Morning leaf assessment is excellent**: -12 bars is indeed the critical threshold for physiological damage\n",
      "- **4PM silk/tassel checks are well-timed**: This captures maximum heat stress period when pollen viability is most compromised\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Recommendations\n",
      "1. **Irrigation refinement**:\n",
      "   - Focus on maintaining 0.25-0.30 inch/day minimum during R1-R2\n",
      "   - Target soil moisture at 70-80% field capacity specifically at 8-12\" depth (where brace roots are accessing water)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Field prioritization criteria**:\n",
      "   - Fields showing leaf rolling before 10AM should receive immediate irrigation\n",
      "   - Sandy soils need more frequent but lighter applications (0.15-0.20\" every other day)\n",
      "   - Heavier soils can receive deeper, less frequent irrigation (0.40\" every 4 days)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Kernel development monitoring**:\n",
      "   - Check for milk line development at R3 stage (critical indicator of stress impact)\n",
      "   - Monitor ear tip kernel abortion specifically - these are most vulnerable\n",

      "- **V12-VT stage**: Reduced leaf expansion and potential tassel development issues\n",
      "- **R1-R3 stage**: Most critical - heat above 95¬∞F can reduce pollen viability by 80%+, leading to poor kernel set\n",
      "- **R4-R6 stage**: Accelerated dry-down and potential yield/test weight reduction\n",
      "\n",
      "## Immediate Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Irrigation priority**: Apply 1-1.5\" water if corn is at pollination stage (R1)\n",
      "2. **Timing**: Irrigate during early morning to maximize efficiency\n",
      "3. **Field assessment**: Check silking progress and pollen shed synchronization in representative areas\n",

      "- Potentially reduce yields by 3-8% for each day of severe stress\n",
      "\n",
      "## Field Management Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Irrigation Management (if available)**:\n",
      "   - Apply 1-1.5\" water before forecasted heat events\n",
      "   - Focus on early morning irrigation to maximize cooling effect\n",

      "# Corn at V12-VT Stage: Analysis & Management\n",
      "\n",
      "## Stage Characteristics:\n",
      "- Final vegetative growth before reproductive phase\n",
      "- Rapid stalk elongation and leaf expansion\n",
      "- Tassel emergence (VT) signals transition to reproductive stage\n",
      "- Duration: typically 10-14 days depending on growing conditions\n",

      "- Drought stress: Critical period for adequate soil moisture\n",
      "- High temperatures (>95¬∞F): Can damage developing tassels\n",
      "- Wind damage: Plants are tall but root systems may still be developing\n",
      "\n",
      "## Management Priorities:\n",
      "- Irrigation: Maintain consistent soil moisture (crucial for upcoming pollination)\n",
      "- Fertilization: Last opportunity for supplemental nitrogen if needed\n",
      "- Pest monitoring: Critical for corn earworm, European corn borer\n",
      "- Disease scouting: Northern corn leaf blight, gray leaf spot become visible\n",

      "\n",
      "For corn production in the Midwest, I'd highlight these key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Current growth stage sensitivity:\n",
      "   - If corn is in V12-VT stages, drought stress can reduce potential yield by 3-8% per day\n",
      "   - During R1-R3 (pollination/early grain fill), heat stress above 95¬∞F can reduce yield by 10-25%\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Critical management considerations:\n",
      "   - Moisture requirements peak during VT-R3 (up to 0.33 inches/day)\n",
      "   - Nitrogen deficiency during V8-R1 can limit ear size and kernel count\n",
      "   - Root development vulnerability if excessive rainfall occurs before V6\n",
      "\n",
      "To support your risk assessment, I'll need:\n",
      "- Current growth stage across your fields\n",
      "- 10-day weather forecast with temperature and precipitation details\n",
      "- Current soil moisture readings\n",

      "Happy to provide more specific agronomic analysis once I receive this information from your team.# Corn Pollination Weather Risk Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "## Current Situation Analysis\n",
      "During pollination (R1 stage), corn is extremely sensitive to environmental stress. High temperatures (>95¬∞F) can kill pollen, while drought conditions reduce silk emergence and receptivity, potentially reducing yield by 3-8% per day of stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Water Management Priority**\n",
      "   - Ensure 1-1.5\" of water available during R1 stage\n",
      "   - Schedule irrigation 2-3 days before forecasted heat events\n",
      "   - Focus on fields with sandier soils first\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Field Monitoring**\n",
      "   - Track silk emergence daily in representative areas\n",
      "   - Monitor tassel development across production blocks\n",
      "   - Document pollen shed timing and duration\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Heat Mitigation Strategies**\n",
      "   - Schedule irrigation during morning hours\n",
      "   - Avoid fertilizer application during pollination stress\n",
      "   - Consider foliar applications of growth regulators if extreme stress persists\n",
      "\n",
      "Your coordination approach is excellent - the daily soil moisture monitoring is particularly important as water deficits during pollination have immediate irreversible impacts on yield potential.I'll analyze the corn heat stress situation with a focus on growth stages and management.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Corn Heat Stress Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "## Current Situation Assessment\n",
      "The R1 (silking) growth stage is indeed most vulnerable to heat stress because:\n",
      "- Pollen viability drops significantly above 95¬∞F\n",
      "- Silk receptivity and fertilization are highly temperature-sensitive\n",
      "- Heat stress during pollination directly reduces kernel count, causing irreversible yield loss\n",
      "\n",
      "## Stage-Specific Vulnerability\n",
      "1. **R1 fields (silking)**: Highest priority - heat can cause asynchrony between pollen shed and silk emergence\n",
      "2. **R2 fields (blister)**: High priority - kernel abortion still possible if photosynthesis is limited\n",
      "3. **R3 fields (milk)**: Medium priority - kernel size determination may be compromised\n",
      "\n",
      "## Management Recommendations\n",
      "- **Irrigation timing**: Early morning irrigation is correct; maintain soil moisture at 75-85% field capacity\n",
      "- **Application rate**: 0.25-0.30 inches per application to minimize plant stress while conserving water\n",
      "- **Coverage**: Ensure uniform distribution focusing on plant bases rather than overhead\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recovery Assessment\n",
      "Heat stress during R1 cannot be fully mitigated, but maintaining adequate soil moisture will:\n",
      "- Reduce silk desiccation\n",
      "- Help maintain pollen viability\n",
      "- Support continued ear development\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated several key concepts for **automatic control flow** in multi-agent systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü§ñ **Autonomous Decision Making**\n",
    "- **LeadCoordinator** automatically determines which agents to engage based on request analysis\n",
    "- **Dynamic agent spawning** when conditions warrant (severe weather ‚Üí MitigationPlanner)\n",
    "- **Adaptive workflows** that change based on discovered conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåê **Multi-Agent Coordination Tools**\n",
    "- **`agent_graph`**: Creates mesh networks where agents communicate directly\n",
    "- **`swarm`**: Enables collaborative intelligence for complex analysis\n",
    "- **`mem0_memory`**: Provides persistent context and learning across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ **Real-World Integration**\n",
    "- **National Weather Service API**: Live weather data driving decisions\n",
    "- **Domain-specific agents**: Meteorology, Agronomy, Risk Assessment specialists\n",
    "- **Threshold-based triggers**: Automatic escalation based on risk levels\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìà **Scalability Patterns**\n",
    "- **Mesh topology**: All agents can communicate without bottlenecks\n",
    "- **Event-driven coordination**: Weather alerts trigger cascading responses\n",
    "- **Memory-driven context**: Past decisions inform current actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÑ **Next Steps for Production**\n",
    "1. **Deploy NWS tools as MCP server** for scalable weather data access\n",
    "2. **Add more specialized agents** (DataViz, CitationAgent, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Implement threshold-based spawning logic** in agent prompts\n",
    "4. **Add observability** with LangFuse integration\n",
    "5. **Scale to multiple geographic regions** and crop types\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of this approach is that **agents decide their own control flow** - the system adapts automatically to changing conditions without requiring human intervention to manage the workflow.\n"
