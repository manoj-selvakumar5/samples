    "# 🌽 Corn Production Intelligence – Automatic Multi-Agent Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **automatic control flow** for a corn-production analysis system that relies on real-time weather data fetched from the National Weather Service (NWS) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Strands concepts in action:\n",
    "1. `agent_graph` – mesh network of specialized agents\n",
    "2. `swarm` – collaborative sub-tasks if extra brainstorming is required\n",
    "3. Custom tools wrapping NWS endpoints: `get_alerts`, `get_forecast`\n",
    "4. `mem0_memory` – persistent memory across agent interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents will decide their own control flow: when severe weather is detected, they automatically spawn a MitigationPlanner agent and route the workflow without human prompts.\n",

      "## Summary of Risk Assessment\n",
      "Based on the integrated weather and agronomic analysis, corn production in Central Iowa faces **moderate to high risk** over the next two weeks, primarily due to developing moisture stress coinciding with critical growth stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Risk Factors\n",
      "\n",
      "### Critical Weather Concerns\n",
      "- **Heat stress risk is escalating** with forecasted 90-94°F temperatures during days 5-8\n",
      "- **Precipitation deficit** (0.75 inches below normal) is likely to worsen with only minimal rainfall expected\n",
      "- **Soil moisture depletion** in the root zone will accelerate with high evapotranspiration rates (0.25-0.30 inches/day)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Agronomic Impact Analysis\n",
      "- Current growth stage (V8-V10) is entering a critical period of yield determination\n",

      "**R1-R3 (Pollination/Early Grain Fill) - HIGHEST RISK**\n",
      "- Heat above 95°F can reduce pollen viability by 20-40%\n",
      "- Each day of severe stress during pollination can reduce yield by 3-8%\n",
      "- Silking and pollen shed synchrony is disrupted by heat/moisture stress\n",
      "- Your immediate irrigation prioritization for pollinating fields is essential\n",
      "\n",
      "**V12-VT (Late Vegetative) - MODERATE RISK**\n",
      "- Fields in this stage need adequate moisture as they determine ear size potential\n",

      "- Your recommendation for regular scouting is appropriate\n",
      "\n",
      "**R4-R6 (Grain Fill) - MONITORING NEEDED**\n",
      "- While less sensitive than pollination, stress during grain fill affects kernel weight\n",
      "- The fungicide application strategy is sound as diseases can limit photosynthesis\n",
      "- Monitor stalk integrity as plants may cannibalize nutrients under stress\n",
      "\n",
      "## Additional Management Considerations\n",
      "1. Consider foliar applications with micronutrients (zinc, boron) to support pollination\n",
      "2. Monitor soil moisture at 12\" and 24\" depths to optimize irrigation efficiency\n",
      "3. Be vigilant for secondary pests that target stressed plants (spider mites, earworms)\n",
      "4. Track growing degree days to predict development stages in different field zones\n",

      "- Heavy rainfall (nutrient leaching, potential flooding)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Specific Impact Analysis\n",
      "- **Wind concerns**: Plants are reaching maximum height with developing tassels. Winds >40mph can cause greensnap (stalk breakage) with limited recovery potential.\n",
      "- **Hail impact**: Direct hits to emerging tassels can severely impact pollination success, with 20-40% yield reduction potential.\n",
      "- **Water issues**: Saturated fields reduce oxygen to roots during this rapid growth phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Post-Storm Assessment Protocol\n",
      "1. Document damage within 24-48 hours\n",
      "2. Assess percentage of plants with:\n",

      "2. **Irrigation Priority Matrix**:\n",
      "   - Highest: Fields at 50-75% pollination with visible silk emergence\n",
      "   - High: Fields approaching pollination (within 3-5 days)\n",
      "   - Moderate: Fields past 75% pollination completion\n",

      "   - Secure nitrogen source for possible rescue application\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Post-Storm Assessment Protocol**:\n",
      "   - Wait 3-5 days to properly evaluate recovery potential\n",
      "   - Perform root lodging recovery test (plants should straighten within 7 days)\n",
      "   - Assess nitrogen status with tissue testing 5-7 days post-storm\n",

      "## Quantified Risk Analysis\n",
      "- **Timing Vulnerability**: V12-VT is among the highest sensitivity periods for water stress\n",
      "- **Water Deficit**: Current 30% chance of rainfall represents a projected deficit of 1.4-2.1 inches over next 7 days\n",
      "- **Yield Impact Potential**: 5-15% yield reduction is a conservative estimate; could reach 20-25% if stress extends through pollination\n",
      "- **Economic Impact**: Assuming 200 bu/acre potential at $4.50/bu, risk exposure is $45-$225/acre\n",

      "## Critical Thresholds & Intervention Points\n",
      "- **Water Critical Value**: Need minimum 0.2 inches/day to prevent significant yield loss\n",
      "- **Stress Indicators**: Leaf rolling before noon indicates severe stress requiring immediate intervention\n",
      "- **Point of No Return**: 3+ consecutive days of visible drought stress during pollination can cause irreversible yield damage\n",
      "\n",
      "## Risk Mitigation Recommendations\n",
      "1. **IMMEDIATE (24-48 hrs)**: Apply 1.5-2 inches irrigation if available\n",
      "2. **CONTINGENCY**: If irrigation capacity is limited:\n",
      "   - Prioritize fields based on soil water holding capacity\n",
      "   - Apply minimum 0.75 inch per irrigation event for efficiency\n",

      "3. **Yield Impact Estimation:**\n",
      "   - R1 stage heat stress may reduce yield by 3-8% per day of severe stress\n",
      "   - Incomplete pollination often results in scatter-fill ears\n",
      "   - Document with photos for insurance purposes\n",
      "\n",
      "## Post-Heat Recovery\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Maintain adequate fertility:**\n",
      "   - Ensure potassium levels are sufficient to maintain water regulation\n",
      "   - Avoid additional nitrogen application during stress period\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Monitor for secondary issues:**\n",
      "   - Heat-stressed plants are more susceptible to stalk rot\n",
      "   - Watch for increased insect pressure on weakened plants\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Evaluate impact:**\n",

      "\n",
      "## Key Priorities\n",
      "Your irrigation protocol of 1.5-2\" is appropriate but should be applied:\n",
      "- Before 10AM or after 6PM to minimize evaporation\n",
      "- With priority to fields showing leaf rolling before noon\n",
      "- Focused on sandy soil areas first if water is limited\n",
      "\n",
      "## Technical Recommendations\n",
      "1. **Monitor pollen viability closely** - temperatures above 95°F with RH below 30% can cause complete pollen death\n",
      "2. **Silk receptivity window** is only 7-10 days - ensure moisture reaches ear zone\n",
      "3. **Kernel abortion risk** is highest 5-15 days after pollination if stress continues\n",
      "4. **Root depth assessment** is crucial - corn at this stage should have 24-36\" rooting depth\n",
      "\n",
      "## Additional Considerations\n",
      "- Consider skip-row irrigation if water is limited\n",
      "- Temporary reduction in plant transpiration from foliar antitranspirants may help preserve silk viability\n",

      "1. **Heat stress during pollination** - Temperatures above 95°F during the upcoming VT/R1 stages can reduce pollination success by 10-15% per day of extreme heat\n",
      "2. **Water deficit** - Critical water demand (0.35-0.40 inches/day) during this period makes drought particularly damaging\n",
      "3. **Nutrient availability** - Late-season nitrogen deficiency may limit yield potential\n",
      "\n",
      "### Quantified Yield Impact:\n",
      "- Heat stress during pollination: 5-25% yield reduction potential\n",
      "- Moderate drought during VT-R1: 3-8% yield reduction per day\n",
      "- Nitrogen deficiency at this stage: 10-20% yield reduction potential\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Actions and Thresholds:\n",
      "1. **Irrigation priority** (if available): Trigger irrigation at 50% available soil moisture\n",
      "2. **Heat mitigation**: If forecast exceeds 95°F for 3+ consecutive days, consider foliar applications to reduce plant stress\n",
      "3. **Nitrogen assessment**: Quick tissue testing with intervention threshold of <2.8% N in ear leaves\n",
      "4. **Insurance verification**: Confirm specific peril coverage applies to current growth stage\n",

    "## ⭐ Star Topology Workflow Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How the Star Topology Works for Corn Production:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🎯 Centralized Coordination Pattern:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "                    LeadCoordinator (Hub)\n",
    "                    /        |        \\\n",

    "          (Weather)       (Crops)       (Risk)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **📋 Workflow Sequence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Request Analysis** → LeadCoordinator receives corn production task\n",
    "2. **Delegation Phase** → Coordinator sends specific tasks to each specialist:\n",
    "   - **Meteorology**: \"Analyze weather alerts and forecast for Iowa\"\n",
    "   - **Agronomy**: \"Assess V12-VT growth stage vulnerability\" \n",
    "   - **Risk**: \"Calculate yield risk based on weather + crop factors\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Specialist Execution** → Each agent works independently:\n",
    "   - **Meteorology** calls `get_alerts(\"IA\")` and `get_forecast(41.59, -93.62)`\n",
    "   - **Agronomy** analyzes growth stage sensitivity\n",
    "   - **Risk** quantifies threat levels\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Report Back** → All specialists send findings to LeadCoordinator\n",
    "5. **Synthesis** → Coordinator combines all inputs into final recommendations\n",
    "6. **Decision Making** → Coordinator determines if additional actions needed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **⚡ Automatic Decision Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weather-Driven Escalation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if \"Severe Weather Warning\" in meteorology_response:\n",
    "    → LeadCoordinator automatically escalates\n",
    "    → Triggers emergency protocols\n",
    "    → Spawns MitigationPlanner if needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk-Based Actions:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if risk_level >= \"HIGH\":\n",
    "    → Automatic mitigation recommendations\n",
    "    → Emergency timeline activation\n",
    "    → Stakeholder notification protocols\n",

    "2. **Specialist Focus** - Each agent has defined expertise area\n",
    "3. **Centralized Risk Assessment** - Critical for farming decisions\n",
    "4. **Emergency Protocols** - Quick escalation through coordinator\n",
    "5. **Resource Efficiency** - No redundant communications between specialists\n",

    "## 🚀 Key Takeaways: Automatic Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated several key concepts for **automatic control flow** in multi-agent systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤖 **Autonomous Decision Making**\n",
    "- **LeadCoordinator** automatically determines which agents to engage based on request analysis\n",
    "- **Dynamic agent spawning** when conditions warrant (severe weather → MitigationPlanner)\n",
    "- **Adaptive workflows** that change based on discovered conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 **Multi-Agent Coordination Tools**\n",
    "- **`agent_graph`**: Creates mesh networks where agents communicate directly\n",
    "- **`swarm`**: Enables collaborative intelligence for complex analysis\n",
    "- **`mem0_memory`**: Provides persistent context and learning across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Real-World Integration**\n",
    "- **National Weather Service API**: Live weather data driving decisions\n",
    "- **Domain-specific agents**: Meteorology, Agronomy, Risk Assessment specialists\n",
    "- **Threshold-based triggers**: Automatic escalation based on risk levels\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 **Scalability Patterns**\n",
    "- **Mesh topology**: All agents can communicate without bottlenecks\n",
    "- **Event-driven coordination**: Weather alerts trigger cascading responses\n",
    "- **Memory-driven context**: Past decisions inform current actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **Next Steps for Production**\n",
    "1. **Deploy NWS tools as MCP server** for scalable weather data access\n",
    "2. **Add more specialized agents** (DataViz, CitationAgent, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Implement threshold-based spawning logic** in agent prompts\n",
    "4. **Add observability** with LangFuse integration\n",
    "5. **Scale to multiple geographic regions** and crop types\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of this approach is that **agents decide their own control flow** - the system adapts automatically to changing conditions without requiring human intervention to manage the workflow.\n"
