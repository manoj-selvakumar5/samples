    "Key Strands concepts in action:\n",
    "1. `agent_graph` ‚Äì mesh network of specialized agents\n",
    "2. `swarm` ‚Äì collaborative sub-tasks if extra brainstorming is required\n",
    "3. Custom tools wrapping NWS endpoints: `get_alerts`, `get_forecast`\n",
    "4. `mem0_memory` ‚Äì persistent memory across agent interactions\n",

    "Agents will decide their own control flow: when severe weather is detected, they automatically spawn a MitigationPlanner agent and route the workflow without human prompts.\n",
